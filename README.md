# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Researchers from Indonesia


Below are the list of Indonesian researchers that have (currently pursuing) PhD in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing.
I am trying to include all researchers from Indonesia in these fields. 
This list is not exhaustive, please make a pull request to include your name.

The goal is to create awareness and encourage collaborations whenever possible. 
Compared to some other countries in South East Asia, e.g., Vietnam and Singapore, our contribution in AI (e.g., publishing in top-tier conferences, providing off-the-shelf models, tools, libraries, datasets) is low.
Hopefully, the number of participation will keep increasing as inspiring Indonesian researchers might share their experiences and help to connect to world class researchers.

The researchers below are grouped based on their expertise and publications (regardless of the venues).
